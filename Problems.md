`5` students of height `4, 7, 5, 6, 11 units` and width `1 unit`, plan to sneak into a mango garden. The entrance to the garden has a huge wall of `5 units height`, on the 
other side of which a the horrid guard of the garden who wouldn't let the students sneak in if he sees them trespass. In order to sneak into the garden, students 
with height strictly greater than the wall must stoop down and proceed, doubling their width. Your task is to find the minimum width of all the students combined if they 
successfully cross the wall without being seen by the guard.
